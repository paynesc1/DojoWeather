# Dojo Weather App
This is a front end design project using:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

It was built early 2023 when I first started my software developement education at Coding Dojo and it mimics what a web application could look like.

### Coding Dojo
Coding Dojo offers full-time and part-time online bootcamps in software development, 
data science, and cybersecurity. Its three-stack curriculum provides instruction in 
Java, JavaScript, Python, and C#. These programs range from 16-36 weeks, depending on the format.
